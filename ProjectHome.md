FileShare allows you to share files on your Android phone with any device capable of browsing web pages and downloading content (other Android phones, iPhones, Desktops).

You create Shared Folders, and put content into those Shared Folders. In the future, it will be possible to password protect these folders so you can share content with specific users or groups.

To get involved with development, join the android-fileshare googlegroup and introduce yourself.
